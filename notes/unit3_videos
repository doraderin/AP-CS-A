Boolean Expressions / if statements



relational operators (evaulate to true or false)
== equal to
!= not equal to
< less than
> greater than 
<= less than or equal to
>= greater than or equal to

Boolean (logical) expressions 
|| or
&& and
! not 

example:
a || b (will evaluate to true only if both a and b are true)
a || b (will evaluate to true if either a or b is true)
a! (will evaluate to opposite value of what a is) 

De Morgans Law
!(a && b) => (!a || !b) (not a and not b => not a or not b)
!(a || b) => (!a && !b) (not a or b => not a and not b)
!(x > 0) => (x <= 0)
!(x <= 0) => (x > 0)



comparison of strings should be handled by string methods
.equal
.compareTo                  
DONT USE == or !=


if condition 
- will execute if true 
- if no true is found in condition the if statement is skipped altogether

nested if condition
- it wont go in the nested if statement if the statement its nested in is false
- else belongs to the closest if that doesnt have an else (java doesnt care about indentation)
