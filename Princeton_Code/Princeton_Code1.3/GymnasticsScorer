//22.  A gymnast's score is determined by a panel of 6 judges who each decide a score between 0.0 and 10.0. The final score is determined by discarding the high and low scores, and averaging the remaining 4. Write a program GymnasticsScorer.java that takes 6 real command line inputs representing the 6 scores and prints their average, after throwing out the high and low scores.
import java.util.Scanner;

class GymnasticsScorer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("enter score 1: ");
        double s1 = s.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("enter score 2: ");
        double s2 = s.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("enter score 3: ");
        double s3 = s.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("enter score 4: ");
        double s4 = s.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("enter score 5: ");
        double s5 = s.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("enter score 6: ");
        double s6 = s.nextDouble();
        
        double biggest = 0;
        double smallest = 0;
        
       if (s1 > smallest){
            smallest = s1;
        }
        if(s2 < smallest){
            smallest = s2;
        }

        }
        double sum = (s1+s2+s3+s4+s5+s6) - (biggest+smallest);
        double avg = sum / 4;
        
        System.out.print("the avg of scores without highest and lowest is "+ avg);
