** CONSTRUCTORS **
- Constructors must have the same name as the class
- Constructors have no return type

If there is no constructor in a class:
- 0 for int and double, false for boolean, and null for all reference types 
- Constructor is needed if you need to initialize instance variables of your class



** POSTCONDITION/PRECONDITION **
Precondition = condition that must be true for your method code to work (ex: assumption that the parameters have values and are not null)
Postcondition = describe the outcome of running the method (ex: what is being returned or the changes to the instance variables)
- Preconditions should be about the parameters of the constructor
- It is reasonable to set int parameter values to positive and for strings to not be empty

Example: 
Preconditions for “Order Food”: Customer enters restaurant. Staff is ready to take the order.
Postconditions for “Order Food”: Customer orders the food. Staff takes the order.



** ACESSORS/GETTERS **
getter methods = public method that takes no arguments and returns the value of the private instance variable
- used if you want code outside the class to be able to access the value of an instance variable
- return type like int should be written before the method name
