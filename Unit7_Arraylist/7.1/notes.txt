Declaring an Arraylist:
ArrayList<Type> name = new ArrayList<Type>();

** ArrayLists can only hold objects like String and the wrapper classes Integer and Double. They cannot hold primitive types like int, double, etc.

You can get the number of items in a ArrayList using the size() method
You canâ€™t get the size of a ArrayList that is currently set to null, you will get a NullPointerException instead
