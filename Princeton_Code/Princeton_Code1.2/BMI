//22. Body mass index. The body mass index (BMI) is the ratio of the weight of a person (in kilograms) to the square of the height (in meters). Write a program BMI.java that takes two command-line arguments, weight and height, and prints the BMI.
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BMI {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("enter weight in kgs: ");
        double weight = scan.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("enter height in cm: ");
        double height = scan.nextDouble();
        
        double bmi = (weight / (height*height))*10000;
        System.out.print("BMI: "+ (int) bmi);
    }
}
