The class being inherited from = parent class / superclass
The class that is inheriting = child class / subclass

Subclass extends Superclass
    public class Car extends Vehicle
    public class Motorcycle extends Vehicle

- a Java class can only inherit from one parent class
- Inheritance allows you to reuse data and behavior from the parent class
- If no parent class is specified using the extends keyword, the parent class will be Object
- a child class inherits all the parent class object field and methods



** is-a VS has-a (terms to describe relationships between classes)
is-a
    = one class is a specialized version of another class
    ex: bird class, karga class, "karga is a bird", karga is a subclass of bird and inherits all behaviours and properties

    class Bird {
    // properties and methods
    }
    class Karga extends Bird {
        // additional properties and methods specific to Karga
    }

has-a 
    = one class has another class as a part or component
    ex: car class, engine class, "car has an engine", Car contains an instance of the Engine class

    class Engine {
    // properties and methods
    }
    class Car {
        Engine carEngine;  // Car has an Engine
        // other properties and methods
    }
